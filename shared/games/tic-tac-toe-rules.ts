export default 'Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first is the winner. If the grid fills up with neither player achieving three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.'
